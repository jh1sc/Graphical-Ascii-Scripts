## Requirements ðŸ§¹
- WINDOWS POWERSHELL, yes unfortunately these scripts only run on Win-Powershell (For Now Atleast)
- Make Sure when you run the Scripts you set the font to Raster 8x8, You can do this by Right clicking the heading, go to font and set it to raster 8x8 (if anyone knows how to set the font/font size with powershell please tell me)
- When Starting the script give it a sec to load, if you dont it will be really buggy and glitchy, then after the sec maximize the console!
- Thats All! - Coded with pure powershell, no external modules!
