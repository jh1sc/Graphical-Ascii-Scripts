## Requirements ðŸ§¹
- These scripts are currently designed to be executed exclusively within the Windows PowerShell environment. 
- To ensure optimal performance, it is recommended that the font be set to Raster 8x8 prior to running the scripts. This can be accomplished by right-clicking the header, navigating to the 'font' option, and selecting Raster 8x8. If you are aware of an alternative method for setting the font or font size within PowerShell, please do not hesitate to share. 
- Allow a moment for the script to fully load before interacting with it, as failure to do so may result in glitches or other undesirable behavior. Once the script has loaded, it is recommended that the console be maximized for the best experience. These scripts were developed utilizing only native PowerShell functionality and do not require any external modules.

- Thats All!
