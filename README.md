## Requirements ðŸ§¹
- These scripts are currently designed to be executed exclusively within the Windows PowerShell environment. 
- To ensure optimal performance, it is recommended that the font be set to Raster 8x8 prior to running the scripts. This can be accomplished by right-clicking the header, navigating to the 'font' option, and selecting Raster 8x8. If you are aware of an alternative method for setting the font or font size within PowerShell programmatically, please do not hesitate to share!
- Allow a moment for the script to fully load before interacting with it, as failure to do so may result in glitches or other undesirable behavior. Once the script has loaded, it is recommended that the console be maximized for the best experience. These scripts were developed utilizing only native PowerShell functionality and do not require any external modules.

- Thats All!


## Description ðŸ“¶
- This GitHub repository contains a collection of files that utilize 3D, FluidSim, and RayCaster technologies to create a visually stunning and performant simulation. The simulation is displayed through the use of a PowerShell console interface and runs at a smooth 60 frames per second (Most of them). The repository also includes a template file and other resources to aid in the development and customization of the simulation. This project was created as a hobby.
